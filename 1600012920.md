## 2.61
### A.
`!(~x)`
*// if and only if x == 0xFFFFFFFF, ~x == 0, thus !(...) == 1*
### B.
`!x`
*// turn 0 to 1, other to 0*
### C.
`!(~(x & 0xFF))`
*// same as A, but use x & 0xFF to rid higher bytes*
### D.
`!(x & (0xFF << (8 * (sizeof(int) - 1))))`
*// same as B, but use x & 0xFF000000 to rid lower bytes. number of 0s is determined by length of int*

## 2.62
```
int int_shifts_are_arithmetic()
{
    return ((-1) >> 1) < 0;
}
```
*// -1 is 0xFFFF (number of Fs does not matter). if arithmetic, -1 >> 1 is still 0xFFFF, which is still -1 (< 0). if not, -1 >> 1 is 0x7FFF, which if INT_MAX (> 0)*

## 2.65
```
int odd_ones(unsigned x) // 11 operators in total
{
    int a = x ^ (x >> 16);
    int b = a ^ (a >> 8);
    int c = b ^ (b >> 4);
    int d = c ^ (c >> 2);
    int e = d ^ (d >> 1);
    return e & 1;
}
```
*// 0 ^ 0 == 1 ^ 1 is 0, 1 ^ 0 == 0 ^ 1 is 1, thus ^ doesn't change parity of number os 1s. therefore, parity of number of 1s in a's lower 16 bits equals that in x's 32 bit, and so on, parity of number of 1s in e's lower 1 bit equals that in d's lower 2 bit, also equals that in x's 32 bit. so e & 1 is the answer*
